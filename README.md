# Craft CLI

A Command Line Client builder that follows the [Canonical's Guidelines
for a Command Line
Interface](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/design/cli-guidelines/62).

The library provides two main functionalities:

- a framework to define and execute application commands, which
  involves argument parsing and the provision of help texts
- infrastructure to handle the terminal and present all the outputs
  for the different application needs
